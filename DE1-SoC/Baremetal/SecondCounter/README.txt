Hello World example for Cyclone V. Doing make from EDS Command Shell should compile.
It generates a .axf that can be used to Debug. It also generates a .bin that can be loaded by 
u-boot using an u-boot script. It also generates a .img that can be directly loaded from preloader.
To see the hello world connect the serial console to a serial program like putty using 115200 as baudrate.
